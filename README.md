# Statistics
Here i have discussed some standard statistical concepts and their implementation using Julia programming language.
In this reprosities you can find the implementation of some standard statistical concepts namely Monte Carlo method,
Controlled variate method, Important sampling, Accept-reject algorithm, Metropolis Hastings algorithm and Metropolis with Gibbs sampling. 
Also you will found solution of some simple problems related to these concepts. 
Rather than, you will find how we can estimate of the coefficients of a  linear regression line and get their distribution using bayesian concept.
